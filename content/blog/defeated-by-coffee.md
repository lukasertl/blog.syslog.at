I declare defeat.

I bought a [Bialetti coffee
maker](https://www.bialetti.com/it_en/venus-4.html), because a) I love
coffee and b) I thought it would be more sustainable and environmentally
friendly than the dreaded capsules I currently use.

While the principle of the Bialetti is simple, the execution is not, and
so the coffee I manage to produce is, quite frankly, just *blargh*.

Turns out there's a real nerd culture around making a good coffee with
this kind of machine, and I simply don't have the time nor the
patience to experiment with different coffee brands, coarseness
settings, taking the machine off the stove at the right moment etc. etc. 

I just want to drink my coffee.
