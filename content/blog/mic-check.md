Testing, testing, onetwo.  Welcome.

So it looks like I'm dipping my toes into the *blogosphere* like it's
2006 all over again.  Life was easier back then, some might even say
better, but times were certainly interesting, especially for a
passionate OpenSource/Linux nerd like me.

Twitter was still in its infancy, Facebook was on the rise, Google
wasn't evil, and noone tried to shove their algorithm-created crap down
your throat.

I ran an instance of [Antville](https://antville.org) on a university
server for colleagues and friends, and of course we had our RSS feeds,
like any self-respecting news outlet.

I remember that Google ran a fantastic service called
[Reader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Reader), which
unfortunately ended on the [cemetery](https://gcemetery.co) like so many
other Google offerings, but as long as it was available it was awesome. 

Well, life shifted, other things became more important, and the idea of
keeping a personal blog faded more and more in my memory...

Until now!  This is just a test.  Let's see how far it will take me.
