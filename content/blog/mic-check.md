Testing, testing, onetwo... Welcome!

So, looks like I'm dipping my toes into the *blogosphere* again, like
it's 2006 all over.  Life was easier back then, some might even say
better, but times were certainly interesting, especially for a
passionate OpenSource/Linux nerd like me.

Twitter was still in its infancy, Facebook was on the rise, Google
wasn't evil, and noone tried to shove their algorithm-created crap down
your throat.

I remember that Google had a fantastic service called
[Reader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Reader), which
unfortunately ended on the [cemetery](https://gcemetery.co) like so many
other Google offerings, but as long as it was available it was awesome. 

I ran an instance of [Antville](https://antville.org) on a university
server for colleagues and friends, and of course we had our RSS feeds,
like any self-respecting news outlet.

Well, life shifted, other things became more important, and the idea of
keeping a personal blog faded more and more in my memory...

Until now!

I want to keep it simple this time, which means I don't want to put up
with the mess that something like a WordPress setup entails (PHP,
database, security issues...).  After some research I found that a
Static Site Generator might fit my needs, and I decided to give
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io) a try.

For a supposedly "simple setup" it was actually quite a challenge
to get this blog off the ground - Hugo's documention is a mess - but for
now I'm happy.

This is just a test.  Let's see how far it will take me.
