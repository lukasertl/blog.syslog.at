Last week I happened to visit the [Morawa](https://www.morawa.at)
bookshop in Vienna's 1st District - something I haven't done in a very
long time.

Besides shelves and shelves of books of all genres they also stock a
nice assortment of comics and graphic novels.  Among the Mangas and
Donald Ducks I discovered a comic that I *loved* as a young boy, but
haven't seen since then - Prince Valiant, or "*Prinz Eisenherz*" as it
is called in German.

There were six or seven hardcover books, apparently part of [a complete
edition of Prince Valiant](https://www.bocola.de/eisenherz-foster.html),
and flicking through the pages I had some immense flashbacks to when I
read those comics as a child.

I just *had* to buy the first book of the series, and now that I'm reading
it again I can't help but think that some of the images are actually pretty
violent and gory; not that this is a bad thing per se, but I was maybe 9
years old when I first got hold of it, same as my son is now, and I'm
hesitant to let him read it.

Nevertheless, this is a really nice discovery, and I'm afraid I'll have
to visit the store pretty soon again.
